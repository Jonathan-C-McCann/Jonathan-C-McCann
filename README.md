I've been working in Data Analytics for 4+ years, specializing in creating large exploratory dashboards and data sources. Using Tableau, Alteryx, SQL, and Python, I typically manage every step of the process from project management and requirements gathering, to data modelling, dashboard development, and training. 

My most recent achievement was completing a Master's of Science in Data Analytics, where I conducted thesis research on using SARIMAX models to predict Wildfire Burn Area in Australia using weather and vegetation data. You can view that project right here on my Github.
